# zed_net
zed_net is a single file, public domain library that provides a simple wrapper around BSD sockets (Winsock 2.2 on Windows), intended primary for use in games. Both UDP and TCP sockets are supported. (Thanks, Smilex!)

This is my first library, and any suggestions/concerns are welcomed! ([@TheZedZull](https://twitter.com/TheZedZull) or thezedzull -at- gmail -dot- com)
